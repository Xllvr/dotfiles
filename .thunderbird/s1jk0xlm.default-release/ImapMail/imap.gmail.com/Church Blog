    <p><tt>Hi Gin Kai,</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Here's the article for this week:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt><u>Synopsis: We might make many plans for our future, but
            who is really in charge?</u><br>
        </tt></p>
      <p><tt>Proverbs 19:21<br>
          Many plans are in a man=E2=80=99s mind, but it is the Lord=E2=80=99=
s purpose
          for him that will stand (be carried out).<br>
          <br>
          In Jeremiah 29:11, we are reminded that God has plans for us
          yet. Plans to prosper us and not to harm us. Plans to give us
          hope and a future. If we would only for those plans to be
          fulfilled we would receive benefits that would otherwise be
          far away from us.<br>
          <br>
          James reminds us in James 4:13-14 that we are but a mist.
          Rather than making plans of our own, we must be reminded that
          it is God's will that we should do something.<br>
          <br>
          Here in Proverbs, the writings of the world's wisest man
          reaches the understanding that we might have many plans, but
          it is God's purpose that will be carried out.<br>
          <br>
          I for one have experienced that manifold. I usually want to be
          prepared and in control, so I make multiple plans and ensure
          that there are backup plans to my backup plans. But God
          usually humbles me; his purpose is the one that will be
          carried out in the end, not mine. If I make too many plans,
          God ensures that what happens is according to his will.<br>
          <br>
          Day to day, we can have many plans for the future. As the
          saying goes, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. This verse
          isn't saying that we should throw caution to the wind and just
          do whatever. Rather, we should make sure that we understand:
          our plans are not how the world is going to turn. If God so
          wills it, then those will go through.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of trying to account for everything and trying to
          wrest control into our own hands, we need to be at peace with
          letting God take the reins for once. After all, he is the one
          who has provided us with everything that we have. Today, as we
          are making plans, let's make sure that we know who is really
          in charge.<br>
        </tt></p>

Hi Gin Kai,

Here's the article for this week

    Synopsis: As Christians we can often be wary of swear words or
    things that seem uncouth. But what standards do we hold for the
    words that come out of our mouths and what standards does the Bible
    set for us?

    Ephesians 4:29
    Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only
    what is helpful for building others up according to their needs,
    that it may benefit those who listen.

    Christians are known to have a fixation over swearing. Or rather, we
    have a fixation over not using what society has deemed 'swear
    words'. This differs from culture to culture, from language to
    language and from person to person sometimes (we'll come back to
    this later). We are often held in mocking regard by others
    (especially the more juvenile) on how we are so holy and righteous
    for not using swear words.

    At the same time, Christians can sometimes be condemned for being
    hypocritical; despite refraining from the use of swear words, we can
    be equally toxic through the words we use. So here's the point that
    I want to make: it's not about what you say, but about how you say
    it. The famous verse that is used to talk about swearing is
    Ephesians 4:29. Do not let any unwholesome talk come from your mouths.

    For sure, swear words are definitely in the league of unwholesome.
    But let's read on. The verse goes on to say: "but only what is
    helpful for building others up according to their needs". In other
    words, unwholesome words refer to anything else than what is
    beneficial for building others up. The original word in Greek
    (sapros) refers to something that is rotten, useless or corrupted;
    yet out of context the meaning remains unclear. It is only if we
    look at the verse on the whole that we understand Paul's instructions.

    Paul isn't just saying: don't swear. After all, the swear words we
    use now hadn't even been invented back then. Rather, it's about not
    letting harmful words leave our mouths. As Christians, we are held
    to a higher standard. It's not just about being holy in the
    colloquial sense and refraining from using swear words. It's about
    being holy in the biblical sense of setting ourselves apart and not
    using our words to tear down others.

    Instead of arguing whether or not we are allowed to swear as
    Christians, what we should be assessing is the content of our words.
    Regardless of what we say, what we mean is even more important. You
    can say the most 'benign' sounding words but have the most malicious
    of intents. That doesn't make it right.

    See, swear words are relative. They differ in language, culture and
    individual. Some people have a lower tolerance for words while
    others have a higher tolerance. It's important not to stumble others
    with our words (1 Corinthians 10:32); even if you think it's
    alright, it doesn't mean that you need to risk the faith of others.
    I don't have to go into why people who find a compulsion to swear
    every other sentence seem to be uncouth to the general populace either.

    As Christians, rather than judging ourselves based on how low we can
    go, let's try to set for ourselves a standard on where we should be
    instead. It's not about how much can we reap benefits of being a
    Christian while compromising the least on worldliness. It's about
    how much we can embody the principles of being a Christian while
    being in the world.

Yours Sincerely,
Daniel Tan

going
 to other things than him to rely on for strength in times of need. Or =
even day to day letting other things take priority over him. But God is =

to remember that firstly, he doesn't desire our obedience without =
reason. He saved us time and time again and even made the greatest =
sacrifice he could have; in response, all he asks for

expect our obedience without reward. Most authority figures expect
 you to obey them without reward. Not obeying them on the other hand is =
meeted with punishment. God however, rewards those who obey him. And to =
note, God has more than enough power to simply command us to submit. Yet =
he allows us to choose. I think if we compare
 to our relationships on earth, the one we have with God is actually =
very reasonable and very rewarding.</font></font></span></blockquote>

Hey bro,

I like your article, always enjoy what you write.

May I ask about the following sentence in your article?

So it is that Christ should be our quintessence: his doctrine is the way =
that we should live. Here, the writer of Hebrews states something that =
is poignant especially in our current times and for all future times: =
Christ does not change.=20

Do you mean =A1=B0poignant=A1=B1 as in sad & regretful, or =A1=B0pertinent=
=A1=B1 as in relevant & applicable?

Cheers
Gin

Hey Everyone,

Just to follow up on the proposed meeting this Sun, see you all 10mins =
after service at the back of the Straits Hall, near the AV Room.
We will keep the meeting short and sweet so that you can go join your =
group lunch, or other appointments after that.

Cheers
Gin

Yup, that=A1=AFll be helpful!
Looking forward to it.

As a reference, for my book study on LUKE, I=A1=AFve already got about =
100 articles (but posted up 10 so far), and would probably reach about =
150-180 articles when I finish with LUKE. Each article is between =
500-1,000 words, making it easy for people to read. I try to offer some =
new learning points, without going too academic. That=A1=AFs the =
experiment for now=A1=AD we=A1=AFll know more what works best as we hear =
feedback from people.

Cheers
Gin

Hey Daniel,

Thanks for the writeup.
You can look around at the website, to decide what articles you want to =
send.
You can do a Book Study (like the series I=A1=AFm planning to take =
1-year to write for Luke), or a topical one (I can start a new sub-page =
for you), or if it is just random ones, I=A1=AFll put it under Insights =
or Reflections.

Thanks bro!

Cheers
Gin

Hey Daniel,

Thanks for the article. I like your insight.
I=A1=AFve put your article up on the website =
https://jesus365.church/2019/03/12/the-scalpel-the-chainsaw-and-the-white-=
flag/ =
<https://jesus365.church/2019/03/12/the-scalpel-the-chainsaw-and-the-white=
-flag/>

I have done some edits to the article
- Inserted in the scriptures into the most appropriate parts of the =
article so that readers can read it more conveniently (many don=A1=AFt =
turn separately to the bible to read the scriptures)
- Given more context (because there are a lot of readers who are not =
disciples from our church, who don=A1=AFt even use the term =
=A1=B0discipling=A1=B1 or know what "speaking the truth in love" means).=20=

- Rephrased and added some sentences to make your insights clearer.

I appreciate you a lot, bro. Hope you can contribute more and help =
people grow in the Lord!!

Thanks, bro!!

Cheers
Gin Kai

Hi Everyone,

Hope you had a great weekend and a good day at church today.

You=A1=AFre included in this email because you had volunteered to be a =
contributing writer when we announced the Digital Ministry a few months =
ago=A1=AD or you were arrowed :)

Anyway, the Digital Team had spent the last few months trying to get =
things organised, and we=A1=AFre ready to pick up speed now. We=A1=AFre =
starting to collate completed articles, so if you=A1=AFve got any =
previously written ones, I=A1=AFll be grateful if you can send some to =
me.

We also look forward to working closely with you to write new ones. Here =
are some guidelines on writing of articles:

1. AVOID writing anything political or insulting to other religions

2. BE CAUTIOUS when writing about =A1=B0controversial=A1=B1 issues like =
LGBT, Pro-life/Pro-choice, etc.=A1=AD you can write about them, but be =
careful when you do that

3. WELCOME=20
	- Insights from your bible study
	- Reflections on a topic
	- Commentary
	- Poetry
	- Bible Talk material
	- Follow Up Studies or Quiet Time series you=A1=AFve created, =
etc.
	- Etc.

4. OTHER THOUGHTS
	- Between 300 words to 2,000 words (ideally 500-1,000 words)

I would love to meet up with you all for 20 minutes after church one of =
these Sundays. May I know if 17 March is OK for you all?
In the meantime, do send me anything that you may already have written!=20=


Many thanks for your heart in serving God and His Kingdom!!

Love,
Gin Kai
