shortdesc Presentations with Plain TeX
longdesc The package offers a collection of simple macros for preparing
longdesc presentations in Plain TeX. Slide colour and text colour may be
longdesc set, links between parts of the presentation, to other files,
longdesc and to web addresses may be inserted. Images may be included
longdesc easily, and code is available to provide transition effects
longdesc between slides or frames. The structure of the macros is not
longdesc overly complex, so that users should find it easy to adapt the
longdesc macros to their specific needs.
