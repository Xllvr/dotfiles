shortdesc Draw continuous or discrete spectra using PGF/TikZ
longdesc The purpose of this package is to draw the spectra of elements
longdesc in a simple way. It is based on the package pst-spectra,
longdesc supporting the same options, but also adding some new options.
longdesc It relies on PGF/TikZ for drawing the desired spectrum,
longdesc continuous or discrete. As in pst-spectra, there are data
longdesc available for the spectra of 99 elements and their ions (from
longdesc the NASA database). It also allows the user to draw spectra
longdesc using their own data.
