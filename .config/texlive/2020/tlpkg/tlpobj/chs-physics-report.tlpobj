shortdesc Physics lab reports for Carmel High School
longdesc This package may optionally be used by students at Carmel High
longdesc School in Indiana in the United States to write physics lab
longdesc reports for FW physics courses. As many students are beginners
longdesc at LaTeX, it also attempts to simplify the report-writing
longdesc process by offering macros for commonly used notation and by
longdesc automatically formatting the documents for students who will
longdesc only use TeX for mathematics and not typesetting. The package
longdesc depends on amsmath, calc, fancyhdr, geometry, graphicx,
longdesc letltxmacro, titlesec, transparent, and xcolor.
