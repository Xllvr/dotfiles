shortdesc A key-defining frontend for expkv
longdesc This package provides a key=val interface to define keys for
longdesc expkv. This is done to provide a simple frontend to define
longdesc different common key types, similar to how keys are defined in
longdesc other well established key=value packages like pgfkeys or
longdesc l3keys. expkv-def is generic code and only requires expkv for
longdesc its parsing. There is a LaTeX package expkv-def.sty included to
longdesc play nicely on LaTeX's package loading system, but that package
longdesc is not needed and does not provide more functionality than the
longdesc generic code in expkv-def.tex.
