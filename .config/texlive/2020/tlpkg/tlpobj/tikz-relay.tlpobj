shortdesc TikZ library for typesetting electrical diagrams
longdesc This package contains a collection of symbols for typesetting
longdesc electrical wiring diagrams for relay control systems. The
longdesc symbols are meant to be in agreement with the international
longdesc standard IEC-60617 which has been adopted worldwide, with
longdesc perhaps the exception of the USA. It extends and modifies, when
longdesc needed, the TikZ-libray circuits.ee.IEC. A few non-standard
longdesc symbols are also included mainly to be used in presentations,
longdesc particularly with the beamer package.
