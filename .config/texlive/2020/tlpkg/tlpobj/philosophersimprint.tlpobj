shortdesc Typesetting articles for "Philosophers' Imprint"
longdesc In its mission statement we read "Philosophers' Imprint is a
longdesc refereed series of original papers in philosophy, edited by
longdesc philosophy faculty at the University of Michigan, with the
longdesc advice of an international Board of Editors, and published on
longdesc the World Wide Web by the University of Michigan Digital
longdesc Library. The mission of the Imprint is to promote a future in
longdesc which funds currently spent on journal subscriptions are
longdesc redirected to the dissemination of scholarship for free, via
longdesc the Internet". The class helps authors to typeset their own
longdesc articles in "Web-ready" format. No assumption is made about the
longdesc fonts available to the author: the class itself is restricted
longdesc to freely available and freely distributed fonts, only.
