shortdesc A package for easy figure arrangement
longdesc MiniPlot is a package to help the LaTeX user typeset EPS
longdesc figures using an easy-to-use interface. Figures can be arranged
longdesc as one-figure-only or as a collection of figures in columns and
longdesc rows which can itself contain sub-figures in columns and rows.
longdesc Wrapped figures are also supported. This package provides
longdesc commands to display a framebox instead of the figure as the
longdesc graphics package does already but additionally it writes useful
longdesc information such as the label and scaling factor into these
longdesc boxes.
