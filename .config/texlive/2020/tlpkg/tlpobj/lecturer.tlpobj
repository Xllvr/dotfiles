shortdesc On-screen presentations for (almost) all formats
longdesc The package creates slides for on-screen presentations based on
longdesc PDF features without manipulating TeX's typesetting process.
longdesc The presentation flow relies on PDF's abilities to display
longdesc content step by step. Features include: Free positioning of
longdesc anything anywhere in painted areas on the slide, as well as in
longdesc the main textblock; Numerous attributes to control the layout
longdesc and the presentation flow, from TeX's primitive dimensions to
longdesc the visibility of steps; Feature inheritance from global to
longdesc local settings, with intermediate types; Basic drawing
longdesc facilities to produce symbols, e.g., for list items or buttons;
longdesc Colours, transparency, shades, and pictures; Navigation with
longdesc links, pop-up menus, and customizable bookmarks; Easy switch
longdesc between presentation and handout; and PDF transitions. Besides
longdesc the traditional documentation, the distribution includes visual
longdesc documentation and six demo presentations ranging from geometric
longdesc abstraction to classic style to silly video game. Lecturer is
longdesc designed to work with all formats, but presently fails with
longdesc ConTeXt MkIV (because of clashes in management of PDF objects,
longdesc probably), works only with pdfTeX and LuaTeX for the time
longdesc being, and requires texapi and yax, both v.1.02.
