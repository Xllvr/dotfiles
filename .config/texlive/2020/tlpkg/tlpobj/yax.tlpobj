shortdesc Yet Another Key System
longdesc YaX is advertised as a key system, but it rather organizes
longdesc attributes in parameters, which parameters can be executed, so
longdesc that YaX is halfway between key management and macro definition
longdesc (and actually hopes to provide a user's interface). Values
longdesc assigned to attributes can be retrieved and tested in various
longdesc ways, with full expandability ensured as much as possible.
longdesc Finally, YaX's syntax is a quite peculiar (as few braces as
longdesc possible), but may be customized. YaX is based on texapi and
longdesc thus requires e-TeX.
