      LaTeX Style for  Environmental and Engineering Geophysical
		   Society's Annual Meeting Papers
			     Version 1.0


The Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society (EEGS) is an
international scientific organization with about 700 members.  One of
its main activities is its annual meetings, the Application of
Geophysics to Engineering and Environmental Problems (SAGEEP).  The
papers for this meeting are accepted as PDF files.  This class
typesets papers according to the guidelines, intended for SAGEEP-2009.
It should probably work for the future SAGEEP, unless EEGS changes its
guidelines.

The class was commissioned and paid for by US Army Corps of Engineers,
Engineer Research and Development Center, 3909 Halls Ferry Road,
Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199.
