  \maketitle

  \opening{Dear Prof. Bonette,}

  I'd like to congratulate you and the other professors of your
  university on the very instructive video lectures
  provided by your University. They are valued very
  highly.

  You inspired many a professor at our university to provide more
  technical content beyond classical paper courses.
  Based on your inspiring lectures, some students desire to candidate
  themselves for taking an internship at your university. You can find
  their details enclosed.

  Below, you can find a few more paragraphs to illustrate that this
  class can generate multipage letters.
