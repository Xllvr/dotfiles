As of 2010, The Karel de Grote University College has 
adopted a new house style. 
This class file implements the house style for course texts.
Using this class file will make it easy for you to make and 
keep your course texts compliant to this version and future 
versions of the KdG house style.

If you think
  - there's an error in compliancy w.r.t. the house style,
  - there's a feature missing in this class file,
  - there's a bug in this class file,
please, contact us through e-mail (paul.levrie@kdg.be or
walter.daems@kdg.be). We'll provide you with an answer
and if (and as soon as) possible with a solution to the 
problem you spotted.
