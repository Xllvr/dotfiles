\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction.

\section{Contents}
This is some scientific content. Make sure to use the commands from the \texttt{siunitx} package for all numbers. For instance, we have
\begin{gather*}
	\SI{1.2345e6}{\metre\per\second}, \qquad \SI{20}{\percent},\\
	{\sisetup{fixed-exponent=-9,scientific-notation=fixed}\SIrange{80e-9}{120e-9}{\kilogram}}, \qquad \num{5.4321e-9}.
\end{gather*}
For more details about the typesetting in GAMMAS, we refer to \cite{kern2019gammas}. For a concise introduction to scientific writing
in mathematics we refer to the excellent monograph \cite{higham1998handbook}. Consult the documentation of the \texttt{amsmath}\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath}} package for useful hints on typesetting equations in \LaTeX{}.

\section{Summary}
This is a great summary.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Every accepted article for GAMMAS must contain a code availability statement. 
% You can modify the following example to account for your requirements.
\begin{gammacode}
	The source code of the implementations used to compute the presented results is available as supplementary material and can be obtained under the
	\begin{center}
	 	\href{https://doi.org/10.14464/gammas.v1i1.417}{doi:~10.14464/gammas.v1i1.417}.
	\end{center}
	% If you want to attach the code as supplementary material, then this doi will be the same as the doi for your article and inserted by the copyeditor. Otherwise you can use another stable location.
	%
	If the source code is not shared, a simple statement should be given for explanation, e.g.\ for license issues, non-disclosure agreements or trade secrets. For \emph{best practices} for code we refer to \cite{fehr2016best}.
\end{gammacode}
