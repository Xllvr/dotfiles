ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS

AASTEX was designed and written by Chris Biemesderfer in 1988. Substantial revisions were made by Lee Brotzman and Pierre Landau when the package was updated to v4.0. AASTEX was rewritten as a LATEX class by Arthur Ogawa for the v5.0 release. It was updated to v5.2 by SR Nova Private Ltd. Amy Hendrickson (TEXnology Inc.) wrote the v6.0 release which itself was primarily based on the emulateapj classfile created by Maxim Markevitch and Alexey Vikhlinin. Amy Hendrickson also created versions v6.1 - v6.3. Over the years the documentation has benefited from revisions by Jeannette Barnes, Sara Zimmerman, Greg Schwarz, Gus Meunch, Amy Henderickson, and Butler Burton.
