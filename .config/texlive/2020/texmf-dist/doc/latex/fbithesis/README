                  ($Date: 2008-02-17 23:54:50 +0100 (So, 17. Feb 2008) $)

Purpose:
  This is a LaTeX2e package providing a new document-class tuned for
  research reports or internal reports like master/phd-theses at the
  University of Dortmund.

  At the Department of Computer Science at the University of Dortmund
  there are cardboard cover pages for internal reports like
  master/phd-theses.  The main function of the LaTeX2e document-class
  provided by this package is a replacement for the \maketitle command
  to typeset a title page that is adjusted to these cover pages.

Files:
  fbithesis.dtx       Docstrip archive
                        To generate the documentation, run this
                        through LaTeX.
  fbithesis.dtx.asc   Signature file
                        To verify the docstrip archive, run e.g.
                        gpg --verify fbithesis.dtx.asc

Generated Files:
  fbithesis.ins  Batch file, run through LaTeX
                   The file will be generated if you run
                   fbithesis.dtx through LaTeX.
  fbithesis.drv  Driver for documentation
                   The file will be generated from fbithesis.ins.
                   To generate customized documentation, edit this
                   file and run it through LaTeX.
  fbithesis.cls  LaTeX package
                   It will be generated, if you run fbithesis.ins
                   through LaTeX.
  fbithesis.cfg  Configuration file
                   It will be generated, if you run fbithesis.ins
                   through LaTeX.
  fbithesis.dvi  Package documentation, will be generated from
                   fbithesis.drv
  example.tex    Example file which demonstrates the possibilities of
                   this package.  It will be generated, if you run
                   fbithesis.ins through LaTeX.
  README         This file.  It will be generated if you run
                   fbithesis.dtx through LaTeX.

Installation:

  LaTeX fbithesis.dtx   Creates docstrip installation file
                          fbithesis.ins and this file
  (La)TeX fbithesis.ins Creates class file fbithesis.cls, example
                          file example.tex and documentation driver
                          fbithesis.drv

  Docstrip options available:
    package - to produce a (LaTeX2e) class file (.cls)
    driver  - to produce a driver file to print the documentation
    example - to produce an example file, which demonstrates the
                possibilities of the package

  Move fbithesis.cls into a directory searched by LaTeX. (If you don't
                        know where this could be simply drop the file
                        into your thesis' directory)
  LaTeX fbithesis.dtx   Creates the (LaTeX2e) documentation.

    optionally:
  Edit fbithesis.drv    and customize the documentation driver to your wishes.
  LaTeX fbithesis.drv   Generates customized documentation.
                          Depending on your customization you will
                          have to run
                          makeindex fbithesis.idx -s gind.ist -o fbithesis.ind
                          and/or
                          makeindex fbithesis.glo -s gglo.ist -o fbithesis.gls
                          or (if you are using docindex
                          makeindex fbithesis.idx -s docindex.ist -o fbithesis.ind
                          and/or
                          makeindex fbithesis.glo -s docindex.ist -o fbithesis.gls
  LaTeX example.tex     Demonstrates the possibilities of this
                          package.
