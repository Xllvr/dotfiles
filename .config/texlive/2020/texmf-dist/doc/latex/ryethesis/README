This is a class definition for formatting a thesis, dissertation or
project subject to Ryerson University School of Graduate Studies
policy. The following files are provided: 

	README
	ryethesis.ins
	ryethesis.dtx
	ryethesis.pdf
	ryesample.tex
	ryesample.bib
	ryesample.pdf
	figure1.pdf

To create the class file 'ryethesis.cls', 
run LaTeX on the install file 'ryethesis.ins'. 

To re-create the class and usage documentation 'ryethesis.pdf', 
run LaTeX on the file 'ryethesis.dtx'.

For a sample thesis using most of the available options, see
'ryesample.tex'. This LaTeX file will include a figure 'figure1.pdf',
which requires that you use pdflatex, xelatex, or similar. Run BiBTeX
to process the cited references from the file 'ryesample.bib'. You
will also need to recreate the nomenclature, glossary, and index. See
'ryesample.tex' for details or examine the output log messages. Using
pdflatex, the sequence of commands is:

pdflatex ryesample
bibtex ryesample
makeindex -s nomencl.ist -o ryesample.nls ryesample.nlo
makeindex ryesample
makeglossaries ryesample
pdflatex ryesample
pdflatex ryesample
