This is a minimalist class file for formatting manuscripts in the
style described the American Psychological Association (APA) 6th
edition guidelines. Perhaps someday the more traditional (and capable)
apa.cls will gain support for the 6th edition of the APA guidelines,
in which case you should probably use it instead. But in the mean
time, this class may be useful.

Here's a sample document to get you started:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass{apa6e}
  \usepackage{apacite} % This is not done automatically!
  \bibliographystyle{apacite}
  \title{A simple, correct explanation for every aspect of mental function}
  \shorttitle{Psychology: the end}
  \author{Over J.~Optimistic\\Pie in the Sky University}
  \authornote{\dots}
  \abstract{\dots}
  \begin{document}
  \maketitle
  I have discovered a truly remarkable theory which
  this example is too small to contain.
  \bibliography{my-refs}
  \end{document}
\end{verbatim}

This class file is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license, which
basically means you can do whatever you want with it, so long as you
leave my copyright on it and don't expect there to be any
warranty. However, if you're going to make any changes, then it would
probably be less confusing all around if you either send those changes
to me to incorporate into the 'official' version, and/or change the
name of any 'unofficial' versions to something besides apa6e.cls.

Have fun,
