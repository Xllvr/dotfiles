DESCRIPTION

This bundle provides:

   * jmlr class
   * jmlrbook class
   * jmlrutils package

The jmlr class is a LaTeX class for articles for the Journal of
Machine Learning Research (JMLR) or the Proceedings of Machine
Learning Research (PMLR) formerly JMLR Workshop and Conference
Proceedings (JMLR W&CP). It is designed as a replacement for both
jmlr2e.sty and jmlrwcp2e.sty.

The jmlrutils package is automatically loaded by the jmlr class, but
may be used with other classes. (You may need to additionally load
graphicx and algorithm2e, which jmlr.cls does automatically.)

The jmlrbook class is a LaTeX class that can be used to combine
articles written using the jmlr class into a book. The jmlrbook
class uses the combine class and the hyperref package to produce
either a colour hyperlinked book for on-line viewing or a greyscale
nonhyperlinked book for printing. Production editors can use the
makejmlrbookgui application
(http://www.dickimaw-books.com/software/makejmlrbookgui/) to
generate the proceedings. The makejmlrbook Perl script is deprecated
and may be removed in future releases.
