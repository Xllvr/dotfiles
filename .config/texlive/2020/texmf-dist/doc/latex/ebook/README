The file ebook.sty contains a brief description.

Intended use is 

   \documentclass{...}
   \usepackage{ebook}
   ...
   \begin{document}
   \ebook    %  be careful if not the first command
   ...
   \end{document}

Results have been tested with a Kindle e-ink and an iPad mini only.
In both cases the loaded document was rendered almost as expected.  A
command, \pagefill (to be used instead of \newpage), is motivated by a
weakness in Kindle's pdf presentation.

Proper rendering depends on the unit's pdf-reader, and Kindle's is a
little weak in its handling of partly filled pages.

Essentially the page size is set by using the geometry package with
the text area set to 90%.  In addition ebook.sty sets the pagestyle to
empty (including the first page of the ToC).

Ebook.sty is in the Public Domain.
