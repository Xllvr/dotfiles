This small package allows a LaTeX document containing the citation commands
provided by the Harvard package (Peter Williams and Thorsten Schnier)
to be compiled using the natbib package (Patrick W. Daly). Migration from
harvard to natbib thus can be achieved simply by replacing

\usepackage{harvard}

with

\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{har2nat}

---IMPORTANT---
har2nat must not be loaded before the natbib package as it redefines
the natbib commands \cite and \citeyear. All other natbib commands remain
unchanged and can be used alongside the Harvard commands.
