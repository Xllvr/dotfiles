This is the Air Force Institute of Technology thesis class.
It is based on the standard LaTeX2e report class and 
uses the caption2 style from Harald Sommerfeldt to 
provide nice hung captions.  This was ported to
LaTeX2e from an archaic nasty latex 209 version.

The afthesis.cls also uses excerpts from doublespace.sty
as needed to provide clean doublespace support.

usethesis.tex provides some minimal documentation.


Those portions of this class not covered by other
copyrights (like those portions from doublespace)
are in the public domain.  

This is my first attempt at class writing and
I appreciate any and all comments.  There is no
.dtx version.
