This document class and the documentation are distributed according to
the LaTeX Project Public License, see

Requirements
------------
The document class should run with any standard LaTeX distribution from
2007 or later; it was tested with TeXlive 2007. The following packages
are needed:

caption  - for adapting the figure and table captions
ifthen   - for adding an if-then-else-construct
geometry - for specifying page dimensions
mathptmx - for using the Times Roman font
url      - for typesetting e-mail addresses and URLs

All these should be available in a standard LaTeX distribution.


Installation
------------

Put elbioimp.cls in a folder when LaTeX will find it. (Remember to
rebuild the file name database.)

If you don't know how to do this, you can just put elbioimp.cls in the
same folder as your LaTeX file.


Documentation
-------------

See the enclosed file elbioimp.pdf. To create this PDF file, let LaTeX
process elbioimp.dtx.


Use
---

Make a copy of elbioimp-basis.tex. Modify the settings (as specified
in the comments -- look particularly for the word "OPTION") and write
your article.
