Purpose
-------

The navydocs package provides an easy means for creating title pages 
and the following supplementary material pages used in technical reports 
by United States Navy organizations. These pages are generated by specifying 
the page content via a set of commands and then calling a macro to create 
the page at its occurence in the document. The package in its current form 
provides a title page and a technical components page as used by the 
Carderock Division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (Carderock/NSWC). 
The macros provided within the package can be easily copied and modified 
to support formats used by other Navy organizations. The navydocs package 
is provided in the hope that it proves useful to other Navy organizations, 
with users contributing macros for their organizations. Please email to 
the author any new macros for title pages or supplementary material so 
they can be added to the navydocs package.
