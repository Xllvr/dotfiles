Abstract

Starting with the 2014/15 academic year, the Computer Science department at
Bangor University have standardised the appearance, layout and formatting of all
thesis/dissertation documents for all levels (undergraduate and postgraduate).
This package (containing a LATEX document class) is the embodiment of that
standard. It includes all of the elements of a thesis, and supports a limited
number of customisation options that individual students may choose (or their
supervisors may insist upon). It also makes the process of creating a thesis
very much simpler with the inclusion of several macros (LATEX commands) that
streamline the process.

1 Usage - Class Options

The document class is activated (or loaded) using the usual LATEX command
\documentclass{bangorcsthesis}. The class requires at least one of the following
options to be specified, these dictate what type of thesis the document forms;

[⟨phd⟩] - Doctor of Philosophy / Doctorate
[(pgcert⟩] - Postgraduate Certificate
[⟨mphil⟩] - Master of Philosophy
[(mscres⟩] - Master of Science by Research
[⟨mres⟩] - Master of Research
[(msc⟩] - Master of Science (Taught courses)
[(ba⟩] - [⟨Bachelor of Arts (Undergraduate courses)
[(bsc⟩] - Bachelor of Science (Undergraduate courses)

For example; an undergraduate dissertation for a Computer Science degree (a
B.Sc. course) would start with a document class definition as follows:-
\documentclass[bsc]{bangorcsthesis}.

There are also the following entirely optional modifiers that student’s can
elect to use;

[⟨noindent⟩] - Suppress indentation of first lines of paragraphs.
[⟨nohyphen⟩] - Attempt (as far as possible) to prevent LATEX hyphenating words
at the ends of lines in the output.
[⟨draft⟩] - Mark the document as draft, this includes adding a watermark to all
pages. This is highly recommended until the document is final.
[⟨serif⟩] - Convert the thesis to use serif fonts for the main body text.
[⟨twoside⟩] - Make the output ‘two-sided’, much like a book. This may only be
required for the final copy to be deposited in certain libraries.
[(serifheadings)] - Convert the thesis to use serif fornts for the headings.
[(nocentredcaptions)] - Make all captions left-aligned, including one line
captions.

2 Usage - Preamble Macros

The class includes several macros that must be used in the preamble, the portion
of the document before \begin{document}. These set several important parameters
such as the degree scheme, supervisors and author details.

\title{⟨title⟩}

The title of the thesis/dissertation. This macro is not provided by this class
but is required in the preamble.

\author{⟨author⟩}

The author of the document. Not provided by this class, but required in the
preamble. It is recommended that the author name is specified as First M.I.
Last.

\date{⟨date⟩}

The date of the document. It is recommended that the date argument is set to the
month and year of submission of the thesis in full, e.g. May, 2014. This macro
is not provided by this class but is required in the preamble.

\degreeScheme{⟨scheme name⟩}

This macro must be used to set the title of the student’s overall degree scheme.
It has a single parameter, the name will be reproduced (verbatim) on the
title/cover page of the thesis. Use of this macro is required.

\supervisor{⟨name⟩}

The \supervisor macro adds a named supervisor to the student’s thesis. (In
theory) an unlimited number of these commands can be used, although LATEX has
internal memory limits. When there is more than one supervisor defined, the
title/cover page changes to accommodate them appropriately. At least one
supervisor must be included.

\bibliographySetup [compressed]

This macro configures BibLaTeX, the successor to BibTeX, to departmental
standards. The Computer Science department have standardised on IEEE
referencing, using Name, Year, Title ordering. This means that the first
citation to appear may not be numbered [1] in the thesis. Use of this macro is
required. If the |compressed| option is set the bibliography style will be
altered to produce one set of brackets for multiple citations in one command.
Please note, this violates the IEEE style guide.

\addbibresource {⟨name.bib⟩}

The \addbibresource macro is not provided by this package, but is required in
the preamble. The parameter is the name of the BibLaTeX/BibTeX database that
should be processed for the document.

3 Usage - Other Items

\acknowledgements [⟨quote text⟩] [⟨person quoted⟩] {⟨acknowledgements⟩}

The \acknowledgements macro creates the standard acknowledgments page for the
front of the thesis. Use of this macro is optional although highly recommended
as there is usually someone to thank for contributing to your work (including
your supervisor). You can optionally include an inspirational and/or funny quote
for the top of the page. If you do not wish to include the quote, simply omit
the optional arguments.

\statements [(signature image filename)]

This macro creates the required statements page for the front matter of a
thesis. This must be included, failure to do so can result in the thesis being
rejected as it cannot be accepted into the University library or other
depositories. If the signature image filename parameter is included, this image
is included instead of a white space for you to sign manually.

\tables

The \tables macro creates the appropriate tables (of contents, of figures and of
tables) for the front matter of the thesis. Tables of figures and tables of
tables are only included when figures and tables are included in the document
text respectively. If the thesis includes other items (for example code
listings), you are responsible for including tables of these items yourself
after the use of this macro.

\thesisContent

This macro marks the start of the actual ‘content’ of the thesis, separate from
the ‘front matter’ (contents, etc.) and the appendices. Use of this macro is
required to maintain correct formatting.

\references [small]

This macro starts the appendices for the thesis and generates an appropriately
formatted `References' list.  This differs from a Bibliography as it only
contains items specifically cited in the thesis text whereas a Bibliography
should contain everything that has been read/used during the preparation of the
thesis.  If the small parameter is included, the font and spacing are altered
for the references section to present a more compact form.

4 Document Section Order

The Computer Science Thesis has a very specific section order; this does not
prescribe the format of your thesis, just the front and back matter.

1. Title/Cover Page 2. Acknowledgments Page 3. Statements Page 4. Contents 5.
Tables 6. Thesis Content 7. References 8. Other Appendices

5 Skeleton Thesis

A very much skeleton document is provided here as a starting point when using
this document class.

\documentclass[bsc,noindent,nohyphen]{bangorcsthesis}
\title{Thesis Title}
\author{Just A. Student}
\degreeScheme{Computer Science}
\date{May, 2015}
\supervisor{Dr. S.P.R. Visor}

\addbibresource{file.bib}
