The mentis class produces the output required for publications at Mentis 
publishers, Paderborn, Germany. Different formats and styles can be chosen. 
This is not an official release of the publishing house - I used the class 
to prepare two books for printing at mentis', kept in contact with the 
publishers and discussed lots of details with them. So mentis.cls should 
be good to start with, when writing a book for Mentis.
