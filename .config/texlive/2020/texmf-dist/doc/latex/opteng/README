%% Abstract
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With this template, and associated style and \LaTeX\ packages, it is possible to estimate the page length of manuscripts for submission to the SPIE journals \emph{Optical Engineering} and \emph{Optical Engineering Letters}. With a strict three-page limit, this is particularly important for the latter. This template gives simple instructions on how to prepare the manuscript.
