      IJMART:  LATEX CLASS FOR THE ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS

The Israel Journal of Mathematics is published by The Hebrew
University Magnes Press.  This class provides LaTeX support for its
authors and editors.  It strives to achieve the distinct ``look and
feel'' of the journal, while having the interface similar to the one
of the amsart document class.  This will help the authors already
familiar with amsart to easily submit manuscripts for The Israel
Journal of Mathematics or to put the preprints in http://www.arxiv.org
with minimal changes in the LaTeX source.

Changes:

Version 1.1: Added environments namedprop and namedprop* for special
             named propositions.

Version 1.1a: Minor documentation updates.

Version 1.2: New table of contents formatting.

Version 1.3: Changed the typesetting of proofs that end by a math
             display.  This involves interface changes.
             Changed table of contents formatting (again).

Version 1.4: Fixed the bug inherited from amsart:  now appendices
             do not cause large indentations in table of contents

Version 1.5: Added compatibility with babel

Version 1.6: Bibliography style now understands fjournal field.
             Documentation update

Version 1.7: Changes in sample file
