kluwer.cls is the Kluwer class file for journal submissions.

klunamed.bst is the Kluwer bibliography style for named references.
klunum.bst is a bibliography style for numbered references.

klucite.sty, to be used in conjuction with klunum.bst, collapses
bibliographic citations such as [3,4,5] to [3--5]. Optional.

klups.sty attempts to select Times for text and MathTime for math
instead of Computer Modern. Not required for journal submissions.

kluwsrc.zip/kluwsrc.tgz contains the documented LaTeX sources of
kluwer.cls. These are NOT needed for journal submissions.

usrman.tex, mouse.eps: sources for user manual. If compilation
fails, please print the PostScript version, usrman.ps, or download a
pdf version usrman.pdf from our website (www.wkap.nl, Author
Services, Journal Stylefiles/Templates).

sampkluw.tex is a sample journal submission.

sampopen.tex is an example of an elaborate opening environment.

Principal changes in this version:

- various bug fixes
- now compatible with the array- and dcolumn packages
- most components of the Kluwer package are now physically included
  in kluwer.cls and no longer need to be loaded from separate files.
