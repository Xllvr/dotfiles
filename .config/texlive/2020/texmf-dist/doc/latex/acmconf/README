To make the class "selfcontained", it contains also the `flushend'
package, which balances columns on last page in twocolumn mode.
This package is Copyright 1997 Sigitas Tolusis, VTeX Ltd.,
Akademijos 4, Vilnius, Lithuania e-mail sigitas@vtex.lt.
It is shipped together with his permission.

This package consists of 5 files:
	acmconf.ins
	acmconf.dtx
	README
	THIS-IS-VERSION-x.y
	Makefile

To extract the `acmconf.cls' and the `flushend.sty' files as well as
the example files:
  unpack and call make (Unix)

Or do it manually:
  latex acmconf.ins
     creates the following files:
		acmconf.cls, flushend.sty
		prepare.tex, submit.tex, accept.tex
		publish.tex, print.tex, error.tex, body.eps
		pubform.tex, pubform.bib

  typeset user documentation
  	latex acmconf.dtx
  If you want to see the documentation of the code, search in the
  `acmconf.dtx' file the line containing `\OnlyDescription' and
  remove the % in front of that command.

  typeset examples
  	latex prepare.tex
	latex submit.tex
	latex accept.tex
  	latex publish.tex
  	latex print.tex
  	latex error.tex
   	latex pubform.tex; bibtex pubform; latex pubform.tex

To install:
   Edit the `Makefile' and `make install' or
   move `acmconf.cls' and `flushend.sty' to a place where your
   LaTeX system will find it.
