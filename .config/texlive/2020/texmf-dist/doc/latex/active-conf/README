The active-conf class
2005   Will Robertson

This class is for typesetting manuscripts for the Active 2006 
conference held in Adelaide, Australia. Its use for subsequent 
conferences is intended.

The design was based on previous years' templates, and is not one
of which I'm particularly fond. The implementation is also fairly
quick'n'dirty, which is a bit embarrassing -- don't pay any mind
to coding ugliness.
