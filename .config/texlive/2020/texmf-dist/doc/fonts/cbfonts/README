The full collection of the CBgreek fonts is now remade with the correct 
encoding and a better tracing routine. The collection is completed with 
new font description files that allow to use the families, shapes and 
series that are available with this full collection; it is completed 
also with the new font description files necessary to use them together 
with the Latin Modern fonts.

This is the /fonts/language/greek/cb/ collection that was included in
the 2004 CTAN snapshot.  It includes a wide range of sizes.

The current cb fonts distribution on CTAN, created by Apostolos, uses a
new encoding vector and has improved Type 1 files, but is available only
at 10pt (hint: \usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}).  Therefore we provide the full
original collection in this separate location.

The METAFONT files have been created by Claudio Beccari who is also
the maintainer of the these files. The Type 1 fonts have been mechanically
generated form the METAFONT sources by using TeXtrace (by P\'eter Szab\'o) 
and PfaEdit (by George Williams). The generation process is described in an
article that will appear on Eutupon (the official newsletter of the Greek
TeX Friends group--http://obelix.ee.duth.gr/eft).
