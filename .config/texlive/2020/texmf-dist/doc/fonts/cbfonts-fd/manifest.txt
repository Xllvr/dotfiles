The documentation file cbfonts-fd.pdf describes what these font description
files are for. Such files, although subject to the LPPL licence cannot be 
modified, because that licence requires a change of name; such names cannot 
be changed (and therefore the file contents cannot be changed) because the 
specific mechanism used by the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS) accesses them
by agglutinating the encoding name with the font family name in all lower case
letters.

Other font description files compatible with the LGR encoding name can be generated 
by means of the specific macros made available by the teubner package.
