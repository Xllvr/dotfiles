The LaTeX package 'gobble' includes several gobble macros not
included in the LaTeX kernel. These macros remove a number of 
arguments after them; a feature regulary used inside other
macros. This includes gobble macros for optional arguments.

The LaTeX package 'gobble-user' provides these macros to the
user level, i.e. using names without '@', so that these can be
used without \makeatletter and \makeatother.

The same macros are provided inside .tex files for use with 
plain-TeX or other TeX formats.  However, the gobble macros
for optional macros require \@ifnextchar to be defined.
