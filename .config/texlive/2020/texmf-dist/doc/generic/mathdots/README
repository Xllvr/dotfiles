Mathdots has maintenance status "author-maintained". The Current
Maintainer is Daniel H. Luecking. The Base Interpreters associated with
mathdots are plain TeX and LaTeX

Purpose:
=======
This package changes the basic LaTeX and plain TeX commands \ddots and
\vdots so that they properly change size when font sizes change, and
when they are used in superscripts and subscripts. It also adds the
command \iddots (for inverse diagonal dots) which slants the opposite
way from \ddots.

In addition, if it detects amsmath in LaTeX (or AMSTeX in plain TeX) it
defines improved versions of the \dddot and \ddddot commands that place
three and four dots on a math symbol (similar to the math accent
commands \dot and \ddot). These also are arranged to change size
correctly and some placement bugs are corrected.

Other (minor) improvements: the commands \vdots, \ddots and \iddots
select the dot from the math fonts instead of the text fonts, so they
always match math punctuation dots. The \dddot and \ddddot commands
select the accent dot (same one placed by \dot).

File list:

README          This file
mathdots.dtx    The code
mathdots.pdf    The manual
mathdots.ins    unpacking script
mdotest.tex     LaTeX test file
plmdotest.tex   Plain TeX test file (requires loading amstex.tex and the
                and something to define the commands \eightpoint,
                \ninepoint, \tenpoint and \twelvepoint)

Installation:

Run tex or latex on mathdots.ins to unpack the files. Copy mathdots.tex
where tex will find it and mathdots.sty where latex will find it. Copy
the remaining files to your documentation area.
