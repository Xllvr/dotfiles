The package contains tools for inserting nonbreakable spaces after
nonsyllabic prepositions and single letter conjunctions as required by
Czech and Slovak typographical rules. It is implemented in encTeX and
provides files both for plain TeX and LaTeX. The LaTeX solution tries
to avoid conflicts with other packages.
