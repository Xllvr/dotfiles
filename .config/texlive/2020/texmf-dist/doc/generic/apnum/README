apnum -- Arbitrary precision numbers implemented by TeX macros
--------------------------------------------------------------
Petr Olsak                                           Dec. 2015

The operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power to an
integer, square root, exponential, logarithm, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos,
atan) are implemented by TeX macros in this package. Operands can be numbers
with arbitrary number of digits (or scientific notation is allowed). The
expression scanner is provided too. The exhaustive documentation (including
detail TeXnical documentation) is included. The macro includes many
optimizations and uses only TeX primitives (from classical TeX) and
\newcount macro.
