Components
----------
The fontch V2.2 package is composed of the following files:
   README         -- this file 
   fontch.tex     -- main macros
   bsymbols.tex   -- macros for boldface  symbols
   TS1mac.tex     -- macros for the TS1 companion symbols
   DSmac.tex      -- auxiliary file for the DStroke option
   fontch.pdf     -- manual of fontch
   fontch_doc.tex -- source of manual

Description
-----------
       This package allows, in plain TeX, to change with a single
command the size of all fonts that are used for text input and math input.
Main text fonts of sizes 8, 10, 12, 14, 20 and 24 points are available.
Fonts of sizes 5, 6, 7 and 9 points are used in subscripts and subscripts of
subscripts of other main sizes.
In addition fontch gives support to:
   - boldface math-italic and boldface math symbols,
   - T1 Latin Modern fonts,
   - TS1 companion symbol fonts.
   - AMS fonts for boldface math,
   - Double Stroke fonts for blackboard bold symbols
 
Requirements
-------------
- In order to use the T1 options LMTone and LMTSone, you need to have installed
  the Latin Modern fonts of version 1.000 or larger. Older versions of LM fonts,
  where the cork encoded fonts had names as cork-lmr10 (instead of ec-lmr10) 
  are incompatible with fontch-2.1. For those fonts you can use fontch-2.0
  which is incompatible with the new naming convention. The old package is in
  CTAN:/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/plain/contrib/fontch20.tar.gz
- In order to use the AMSfont option you need to have installed the AMS fonts.
- In order to use the DStroke option ou need to have installed the Double
  Stroke fonts.

Installation
------------
        You have only to put the macro files fontch.tex, bsymbols.tex,
 TS1mac.tex and DSmac.tex in any sensible place in the texmf tree, like
       .../texmf/tex/plain/fontch/

It is also commendable to put this README file in a proper place such as

       .../texmf/doc/plain/fontch/README

Usage
-----
   For using fontch.tex with the original TeX OT1 fonts (Computer Modern)
just put at the beginning of the document:
 \input fontch.tex

The file bsymbols.tex provides macro definitions for boldface versions
of math symbols. For using it just input the file where you need it.

The fontch package has four options for handling different kinds of fonts:

  -  LMTone     for Latin Modern T1 fonts.
  -  LMTSone    for the TS1 companion symbol font.
  -  AMSfont    for AMS fonts used for boldface math.
  -  DStroke    for Doublestroke fonts providing blackboard-boldface symbols.

The four options are independent. They are activated by setting the
corresponding variable before calling  fontch.tex. For example for
activating all the four options and using the macros for bold math
put at the beginning of the document:

 \let\AMSfont\relax
 \let\DStroke\relax 
 \let\LMTone\relax
 \let\LMTSone\relax
 \input fontch.tex
 \input bsymbols.tex

NOTES:
-----
 (1) There is one modification of the standard behavior of plain TeX. Plain
     TeX defines for the font #3 the same font (tenex) for text, script and
     scriptscript. That is aw full. The fontch package uses sevenex for
     script and fiveex for scriptscript, as for the other fonts.
     
 (2) The use of files il1-t1.tcx or il2-t1.tcx is recommended together
     with the LMT1 fonts.

 (3) Only the cmcs, cmmib, cmbsy and cmex AMS fonts are supported. These
     are used for small caps and for boldface math-italic and boldface
     Greek symbols. The other AMS fonts like the Euler, Cyrillic and extra
     symbols are not supported.

 (4) Only the roman Doublestroke font is supported. The sans serif version
     is not supported.

 (5) There are two main uses of boldface math. One case is the use of
     isolated bold  characters or symbols inside a formula. For this case
     fontch provides bold versions of math symbols and the macro \mb for bold
     math-italic characters.  The plain TeX macro "\bf" yields roman-bold
     characters in math mode.  The name of the bold version of a math symbol
     is obtained adding the prefix "bf" to the name of the normal symbol. For
     example a boldface italic "a" is {\mb a}, a boldface roman "P" is
     {\bf P}, a boldface \Sigma is \bfSigma, a boldface \iff is \bfiff.

     The other case is when one wants to write a complete formula in
     boldface, for example inside a title. For this case fontch has the
     macro \setmathbold that changes the font families 1 (cmmi) and 2 (cmsy)
     to the bold versions cmmib and cmmbsy. The macro  \unsetmathbold resets
     the families 1 and 2 to their original values. These macros should be
     put before and after the formula.

 (6) Usually the macro \setmathbold does not change the whole formula to
     boldface. This is due to the fact that in math mode some symbols
     come from family #0 (cmr) or #3 (cmex) such as "+" or \int. Fontch
     provides macros for the symbols that come from family #0, For
     example the bold version of "(" is \bflparen.

 (7) Math symbols of family #3 (cmex) do not have bold versions. In particular
     \int, \sum and \prod. Nevertheless \smallint is of cmsy and does have
     a bold version.

Modifications from version 2.1
------------------------------
Version 2.2 is a minor bug correction version.
The main change is the inclusion of the fontch.pdf file.

Modifications from version 2.0
------------------------------
Version 2.1 is a minor bug correction version.
The main change is the change in the name of
the cork-encoded LM font files to the new
naming conventions. (cork-lmr10 -> ec-lmr10, etc.)
Fontch-2.1 is compatible with LM-1.000 or newer versions.
Older versions of LM fonts are not compatible.

Modifications from version 1.3
------------------------------

Version 2.0 is a mayor revision.

There are many improvements such as
 -- Proper handling of smallcaps
 -- Support for bold-math
 -- Support for AMS fonts
 -- Support for blackboard boldface
 -- Correction of bugs and scaling.

The behavior of V2.0 should be compatible with V1.3 except for case explained
in Note (1).
