These instructions are written for the installation of this package on
a TDS-compliant TeX system. (TDS is the forthcoming standard for TeX
installations, refer to ftp.th-darmstadt.de:/pub/tex/TDS-compliant/draft/
for more information.) If you don't have such a system, you have to
figure out your directory names yourself.

If you're on a Unix system and want to use make for installation, read
further. Otherwise skip forward to ``MANUAL INSTALLATION''.


------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION BY MAKE:

Edit the Makefile and adapt the values of the following variables to
your system. Sorry, but the values are not collected at the top of the
Makefile, use your editor to locate them. (The Makefile is generated
by Imake, I don't touch it... :-)

    MAKEDIR	[Default: mkdir -p]
		A command to create a directory, including all
		non-existent intermediate ones.

    DESTDIR	[Default is empty]
		This is a prefix that's prepended in front of all
		destination directories, in case your installation
		structure is somewhere else than your run-time
		location.

    INSTALL	[Default depends on the machine I generated the distribution]
		A BSD install program.
		If you have a System V Unix, and you have X11, you can
		use a script named bsdinst.sh or bsdinst or
		install.sh that's located your X11 bin directory.
		If you don't have a BSD install program, you must use
		the manual installation, described below.

    TEXMF	[Default: /usr/local/lib/texmf]
		The root of your (TDS) TeX tree.

Now, type "make install" and everything should be OK.

MANUAL INSTALLATION:


The Imakefile features definitions that look like
InstallTeX<category>(<package>,<files>).

Copy all <files> to a directory that is appropriate for this
<category> and this <package>. (The <category> `Generic' denotes macro
files that can be used with many TeX formats, including plain TeX,
LaTeX, and AmS-TeX.)
    The TDS directory names are $TEXMF/tex/<category>/<package>/,
where $TEXMF is your TDS root directory and <category> is
all-lowercase.
