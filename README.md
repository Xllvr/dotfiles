# DOTFILES

This is a storage of my dotfiles. Currently in this VCM is:

- zsh
- bash
- fresh install shell script

Feel free to use them but as my entire setup is a gigantic experiment, be warned that nothing is stable.

## What these do
### Zsh
Contains my aliases, plugins and such

### Bash
Contains aliases and some ricing

### Fresh Install Script
Meant to be run on a fresh install of an Arch-based distro to get things rolling. Basically step two of the install process once the fundamentals are done

## License
