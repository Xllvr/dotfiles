# DOTFILES

This is a storage of my dotfiles. Currently in this VCM is:

- zsh
- bash
- package list
- fresh install shell script

## What these do
### Zsh
Contains my aliases, plugins and such

### Bash
Contains aliases and some ricing

### Package List
Contains a list of various packages I require for my system and workflow. Seems like a lot, but it's mainly dependencies. Meant to be used with Arch-based distros

### Fresh Install Script
Meant to be run on a fresh install of an Arch-based distro to get things rolling. Basically step two of the install process once the fundamentals are done
